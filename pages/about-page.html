            <p> We are a family run business based in the North West. After many conversations and after planning not one, but three lockdown weddings of our own (all of which were sadly cancelled). We decided to put that money to use elsewhere and start a whole new journey to set up our own mobile trailer bar.</p>
            <p> After spending years on Pinterest looking at all things wedding related, to help us plan our own special day, we struggled to find a bar that we were able to tailor to exactly what we wanted for our wedding. It was clear there was a demand for more inventive bar options for special events, so this got us thinking..</p>
            <p> ​After searching high and lo§w we finally found this beautifully restored horse trailer that had been adapted to the highest spec. We love every quirky detail of our bar and love how versatile it can be, we can dress it for any occasion and will guarantee it will provide a unique talking point at your special event.</p>
